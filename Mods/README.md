<h1>My mods for the Rook.</h1>

<p>I won&#39;t host files here, this only serves as a overview of all the mods I&#39;ve made for the MK1, links to Printables are included.</p>

<p>Hide your messy cables<br />

<p>Designed the Barracks, a box for the Rook with modular tool-less drawers in the back to make it easier to modify to your components. Each drawer fits a full Pi if needed. I only included a blank drawer, if you need one customized, contact me and i can help you.

Features a fan-spot in the lid, designed to pull air trough the front opening, over all the components. The lid can be mirrored in your slicer to move the fan-hole to the other side if needed. 
Print the front mesh with no top/bottom layers and glue in place.

The Rook logo on the front has built in supports, no supports needed on any parts.

2 versions, one with holes if you want to fit a screen-box in the front, and one without. The one without still has markings on the inside for you to drill out the holes if you decide to fit a screen later on. 

Idesigned the holes to fit this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3921391">12864 mount by xbost</a> but you can customize any screen to fit.

I included an adapter for a SKR mini because it seems like that is a common board for the Rook, but any adapter for the original base should fit as it uses the same mount-holes.

Uses m3 threaded inserts and M5 screws for the feet (original mounting holes for the feet)

<p>Sidepanels for your Rook!<br />

<p><img alt="" src="https://github.com/Kanrog/Rook/blob/main/Mods/Images/Barracks%20and%20Shield.jpg?raw=true" /></p>

<p>Finish off your Rook in style with the Shield, side and backpanels to secure your Rook for the ultimate frame stiffness.

Fully compatible with most of my mods, has the mounting holes for a 120mm part-cooling fan and an included fanduct. Right panel has holes for my <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/349249-rook-mk1-legacy-side-mounted-spool-and-extruder">Spool-hanger V4</a>. this panel can be mirrored in your slicer if you want it on the other side.

The right panel (with the spool-hanger) has a mounting-space for a <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004000137001.html">tiny camera</a> if you want to keep an eye on your prints.

Rear panel has simple mounts for zip-ties to hold your wires.

Everything has been oriented for printing, no supports required, i recommend using a brim and having a really good first layer.

Added STEP files if you want to customize the panels to fit your taste.

<p>Mount your SKR Pico & Pi Zero to your frame the proper way.

Made one version for heat-inserts, and one that just screws into the plastic.
