<p>Designed the Barracks, a box for the Rook with modular tool-less drawers in the back to make it easier to modify to your components. Each drawer fits a full Pi if needed. I only included a blank drawer, if you need one customized, contact me and i can help you.

Features a fan-spot in the lid, designed to pull air trough the front opening, over all the components. The lid can be mirrored in your slicer to move the fan-hole to the other side if needed. 
Print the front mesh with no top/bottom layers and glue in place.

The Rook logo on the front has built in supports, no supports needed on any parts.

2 versions, one with holes if you want to fit a screen-box in the front, and one without. The one without still has markings on the inside for you to drill out the holes if you decide to fit a screen later on. 

Idesigned the holes to fit this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3921391">12864 mount by xbost</a> but you can customize any screen to fit.

I included an adapter for a SKR mini because it seems like that is a common board for the Rook, but any adapter for the original base should fit as it uses the same mount-holes.

Uses m3 threaded inserts and M5 screws for the feet (original mounting holes for the feet)
